OBJECTIVE

Your assignment is to write a calculator library. A command-line interface is fine, but don’t spend too much time on it.

You are supposed to take no more than an hour to an hour and a half to complete the test. The code running is much

less important than the architecture of the library. Pay close attention to the extensibility of your code!

REQUIREMENTS

● Commit the code to an online publicly accessible Git repository (such as Github)

● Handle binary operations, e.g. 5 - 6, 8 * 4

● The calculator should be able to handle a full arithmetic expression at once, for example:, e.g. 1 + 1 - 4 * 4

● The library must take Order of Operations into account

● No need to handle parentheses, e.g. ( 1 + 1 - 4 ) * 4

● Must be extendable so that it accepts user-defined operands

NOT ALLOWED

Use of eval() in PHP or similar functions in other languages that allow you to evaluate the equation in a one-liner

OBJECTIVES​

● Demonstrate skills in good code design 

● Showcase development best practices 

● Demonstrate good algorithmic thinking
